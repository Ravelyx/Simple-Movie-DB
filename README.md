# How do I run the program?

You'll need to have java installed. If you already have it installed, go ahead and download the "Program" folder to your computer.

Windows: Go ahead and run `Launcher.bat` from the folder.
Linux: Open up terminal and `cd` to the program folder. Execute `java FilmDatabase.jar` and it should run.
